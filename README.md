# MobileNet V1 & V2 - PyTorch Implementation

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **PyTorch implementation** of the **MobileNet V1 and V2 architectures**. MobileNet is an efficient deep learning model developed by Google, designed for **mobile and embedded devices** with limited computational power. The key feature of MobileNet is the use of **depthwise separable convolutions**, which significantly reduce the number of parameters and computations compared to traditional CNNs.
